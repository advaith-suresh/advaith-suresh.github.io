  <p>
    Hey there! I'm Advaith, currently a third year student at IIT Bombay trying to pursue 
    anything other than my B.Tech in Engineering Physics. My interest currently lies in Music, 
    and most things that I do revolve around that. Hence this website! To document and showcase
    my journey.
